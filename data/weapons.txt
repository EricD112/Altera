	description "Alteran Drone weapons are present on almost all Alteran ships as they are powerful weapons, independent of a ship's loadout. The drone itself is more of a missile, equippped with advanced homing and tracking systems. What makes these missiles powerful is their ability to penetrate shields with minimal energy loss, resulting in hull damage almost independent of the target's shields."
	description "The Drone Launcher holds 20 Drones and 2 drones are launched as twins in quick succession, as a single drone is an easy target for AM turrets. Multiple launchers will fire simulataneously, to further concentrate the missiles. Launching all 20 drones will use 40 of fuel to charge the drones (2 per drone)."

	description "For larger vessels, the simple launchers are inefficient, the Military has opted to use larger Drone bays, launching a swarm of 18 drones over a short time period, overwhelming most AM systems. An Alteran Drone Bay is capable of storing up to 144 separate missiles, and has fuel storage built-in, as the fuel used to power the drones is no longer negligible with such a large number of launches."

	description "The Alterans developed a weapon of massive caliber, specifically for their satellite defence system, the Titan Defensive System (TDS). The damage is insane, even the  Alteran Drone Weapons can't be compared to this. It forms plasma into a beam that burns through any kind of shielding in no time and without shields, they just rip apart nearly any ship before you even notice. However, the massive amounts of energy required make them practically useless without a ZPM, dual wielding one of these is out of the question."

	description "Developed as part of the most recent fleet modernization project, Alteran Heavy Plasma is the result of downscaling the spinal beam built into the defensive satellites. This was done because the older Plasma Beams suffered from a relatively short range. Unlike the standard Plasma Beams, the Heavy Plasma fires in short bursts, rather than continuously, which allowed for hotter and more powerful beams."
