	description `The Namerai system is one of only two systems connecting the Borean and Alteran sectors and lies on the central Alteran Rim, which connects the Borean and Draconic sectors. This makes both Namerai and the inhabited planet of Argus strategically and economically important.`
	spaceport `As is expected from its location, Argus’ spaceport sees a lot of traffic and was expanded to be able to handle it properly. However, a large portion of this traffic lands here in order to refuel, rather than load/off-load cargo. While all landing pads support the exchange of cargo, some are better suited and as such are rarely used for through traffic, with the older pads being the primary target for refueling.`

	description `Asuras is the most populous of the Alteran worlds and an unchallenged industrial center with over 20 billion inhabitants. Unlike most Alteran core worlds, there doesn't seem to be much beauty to be found. Large factory complexes can be found everywhere, and the residential sections are designed for mass housing, rather than looks. There is little greenery to be found in the cities themselves.`
	description `	During the last Alteran war, Asuras was the target if intense bombing and while nature has recovered, sometimes even more than before, the same can't be said for the inhabited parts of the planet. Although that is in part due to the decentralization plan, implemented after the war.`
	spaceport `In part due to the traffic and in part for efficiency's sake, several spaceports were sprinkled around the planet. One of them, usually considered the main spaceport, is located in the administrative capital of the planet. It is as disgusting as it is massive and is made up of simple, purpose-built hangars and terminals, surrounded by large multi-purpose landing pads.`

	description `On this planet, mostly covered in water, floating in the middle of the ocean is the city of Atlantis, a former and presumably still functional Alteran city-ship. It follows a general star shape with arms several kilometers in length with towering skyscrapers on top. Due to both the history and topography of this world, it's still the population center, in fact, apart from a few settlements around the coastal areas in proximity to Atlantis there really isn't much going on. No actual manufacturing and very little mining, instead, the nature is practically untouched.`
	description `	Being a ship, the city is equipped with a shield system, as well as several other defensive measures. During the last war, the Atlantis was submerged in its entirety, making it an unviable target and an incredibly safe location, resulting in exorbitant housing prices, quite similar to the human paradise worlds.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is placed around the city on its arms and appears to be well guarded, not only by the military personnel present, but also by the air support checking every ship before landing. Unlike your usual human spaceport, everything is highly organized here and almost eerily quiet, the personnel immediately take care of both yourself and your fleet.`
	spaceport `	Even the landing terminal is unnecessarily luxurious in design and not a single step behind the rest of the city.  The spaceport bar is very well located, offering great views of the spaceport and the surrounding ocean. The food and drinks here leave nothing to be desired.`

Its oceans and hills are covered by ice throughout most of the year. Despite all the snow and ice, it carries a sizeable population, heavily engaged in mining operations.`
	description `	The Alteran Military also has a heavy presence on Aurelis. Aurelis' gravity is particularly strong, which caused problems initially, but has resulted in a genetically different, unusually well-built population. As such, the planet is very attractive for the army, as grounds for both training and recruitment of foot soldiers.`
	spaceport `Landing in the Aurelis spaceport is actually quite difficult, the port itself isn't too big or busy, but the low temperatures and the regular snowfall cause the spaceport to be buried under snow for most of the time. The spaceport agency on Aurelis is unable to keep up with the snow during storms and their immediate aftermath. To combat this, the spaceport was expanded with a heated section, however, due to the costs involved, the local government has decided against rebuilding the whole spaceport to install this system everywhere.`

Its proximity to the Alteran Core and ideal landscape for agriculture have resulted in very heavy agriculture, covering most of the planet's plains. The natural biosphere is present in the cold or mountainous Regions, as well as some nature reserves. As the destruction of the biosphere would have caused an ecosystem collapse, a lot of effort was put into developing technologies that keep the ecosystem alive, albeit artificially.`
	description `	Apart from a few large cities, the population is spread in smaller clusters around the planet, providing a local workforce for the agricultural sector. The cities are made up of buildings with greenery on their walls and roofs. In recent times, attempts have been made to shift away from agriculture and rebuild the natural ecosystem.`
	spaceport `Most of the Freight traffic is handled by the main spaceport, with intra-planetary transport of the good to the spaceport via an advanced, efficient and fast rail system. As such, a large portion of the traffic here is made up of freighters, landing on pads around freight terminals which are connected to the rail network. Both the freight and passenger terminals were designed to remind visitors of agriculture while simultaneously supplying space for the local ecosystem.`

It's located at the center of the original Alteran territory. For a planet this densely populated, it is covered in a very large amount amounts of both natural and artificial greenery. Significant portions of the planet are left practically untouched, and the ocean is as clean as could be.`
	description `	Being the Alteran capital, Celestis is the seat of government for the Alteran Inner Core and Altera as a whole. The governmental complex is not too far from the spaceport, right next to the waterfront and is generally busy.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is an architectural masterpiece, both beautiful and efficient, more than capable of handling the business it gets. It's positioned on an artificial extension into the ocean, giving a great view of the city while descending.`
	spaceport `	Rather than building up, the Alterans decided to go down, so the majority of the spaceport is located beneath the ocean. The landing pads also act as lifts, moving ships into the lower levels, where they can be parked while the other vessels land and take off up top.`

	description `Dakara is a very rocky and sandy world, used almost exclusively for mining purposes. It used to be far greener, but ended up a bit too close to the sun, resulting in higher temperatures and little rainfall. Members of the resident population can be easily recognized by their darker skintone, compared to the usual, almost white, Alteran skintone.`
	description `	The buildings have only few windows and large air-conditioners and garages on their roofs, to reduce heat and radiation damage coming from the sun. To take it a step further, the designers of the initial building strategy ensured that even the tiniest building can be reached either by a protected above-ground walkway or an underground path.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is located in a hill, right next to the city, with what looks like a landing strip leading the spaceships into the hill. Even though the spaceport is located underground, it doesn't feel cramped at all and considering that this is a mining world's spaceport, it is suprisingly clean and most certainly less dusty than outside. Its underground location improves insulation and cooling efficiency, resulting in an almost pleasant temperature. Unsuprisingly, the view is rather limited.`

Then Draconium was discovered on this world, making it one of the few worlds with known deposits of Draconium. There are multiple large cities located on the main continent and some of the larger mining complexes can even be seen from space.`
	description `	At this point, Draconis is no longer just a mining world, but has been appointed as the seat of one of the progenitors, who rule the eastern space from here. It is one of the most populated and economically strongest worlds of the Alterans.`
	spaceport `Multiple spaceports can be found on Draconis, though the commercial one is by far the largest. It appears to be very busy, but the Alteran government has imposed strict traffic regulations, resulting in an efficient, high capacity spaceport.

Among the planets of the Borean sector, Elarum is the second most populous, with a population of just over a billion, which is siginificantly less than both the sector capital of Noricum and the median of the Alteran Core.`
	description `	The system of Selphius lies on the Alteran Ember Line, a set of systems whose stars show properties similar those in the Ember Waste. The star at the center of this system is dying and the effects can already be felt on Elarum, which has put an end to the planet's economic boom.`
	spaceport `As the dying star has gotten rather unstable, the spaceport has recently undergone several modifications to counter sudden bursts of radiation. Most of the landing pads are covered by shield systems with a short activation procedure. The older terminals were also retrofitted with upgraded shield systems and radiation protection layers, making them bulkier than their original design. Due to these measures, the dying star has had little impact on the volume of traffic at the spaceport, for now.`

	spaceport `The public spaceport was designed specifically to demonstrate the wealth of the people on Halcyon. It is much larger than necessary and has any luxury you could imagine. A significant portion of the foot traffic is made up of spaceport personnel, tasked with caring for the arrivals and departures, guiding them and handling their luggage.`

As with most of the Alteran Core, Heliopolis is a densely populated world and of great importance to the Alteran economy. It was among the first worlds to be settled and predates the time of the Alteran city ships.`
	description `	Similar to other Alteran worlds, the cities are made up of mid-range skyscrapers and parks. The public transport network is well planned out, efficient and reliable, resulting in very little traffic on the roads. In fact, the majority of roads have more park area than actual road.`
	description `	As part of the Inner Core, Heliopolis was an important but well protected target during the last war. It was left practically untouched, with the memorials being the only reminder of the war.`
	spaceport `The main spaceport on Heliopolis looks like it was grown over time and not built as one piece, resulting in a somewhat Frankenstein-like landing area with even different surfaces for the landing pads and green areas of all shapes and sizes mixed in. It does have a certain wild beauty to it that other Alteran spaceports tend to lack, as they are highly organized and planned out.`
	spaceport `	A large park surrounds the spaceport on three sides, with the fourth side bordering a river and its promenade, likely in order to keep the spaceport's noise pollution down. From the bar, located in a corner between the promenade and the park, you have a gorgeous view of not only the main city and its spaceport, but also the sunset behind the skyline.`

It's position as one of three entrances to the Alteran Core and close proximity to Celestis makes it strategically important. While Wyvernhaven is only 2 jumps away, the military still has a large presence on Linirea, as it acts as a barrier for Celestis and the other Alteran core worlds. During the pre-war tensions, the local capital re-built into grid pattern, capable of lowering the buildings underground, to keep the populace safe from bombings.`
	description `	Linirea has a rather warm climate and a green landscape, filled with forests and rolling hills. The local wildlife is mostly harmless and peaceful, making it a fairly popular world to live on.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is located in the outskirts of the largest city and built similarly to the city, with landing pads slightly below ground. In case of an attack, the pads can be covered and moved even lower if necessary. Since they are underground, the terminals consist of long, well decorated pathways with few windows, exclusively towards the landing pads and a handful of halls with open spaces or greenery.`

The climate is rather temperate, making it more habitable than most of the surrounding systems, but due to its out of the way location and lack of valuable raw materials, it has been unable to grow into a world of economic importance.`
	description `	Although not it's not particularly strong, economically, Mandrona is still a well-developed industrial and urban world with a moderate population. Various attempts were made, over the last couple centuries, to change this and the most recent attempt seems to have been at least somewhat successful, resulting in immigration and an influx of industry, mainly manufacturing and refining.`
	spaceport `One of the economic attraction attempts, also came with an investment to expand the spaceport. The result is a relatively recent and efficient design, similar to other high-capacity spaceports in Alteran space. For now, however, the spaceport is a bit oversized, as the choice was made to add a significant amount of spare capacity, to account for future growth. As such, many of the landing pads are empty and a portion of the spaceport is not currently in use.`

	description `	Meldinium's slightly acidic Atmosphere is still breathable but has become increasingly unhealthy for Alterans and while it was not ideal to begin with, the mining activity has pushed the acidity closer to the limit for habitability. As such, strict regulations regarding protection against the environment/atmosphere are in place for buildings and vehicles. The population on Meldinium works almost exclusively in the mining industry or necessary services and large indoor greenspaces are present in every city, to ensure a healthy lifestyle for the Inhabitants.`

Hidden beneath the forests of Noctillum lie an abundance of resources which are extracted at various locations and refined locally. As most of the local population works at the extraction and refining sites, large settlements are almost exclusively in proximity of these sites.`
	description `	 With the large and plentiful trees in and around the cities, many buildings are constructed with wood as their main component. Some smaller buildings are even built vertically along the stems of particularly thick trees.`
	spaceport `As the inhabited areas are surrounded by dense forests, unsuitable for flight, Noctillum's spaceport is located much closer to the equator, a region that the forests have been unable to reach. The settlements are connected by an extensive high-capacity rail network, transporting goods and people at high speeds. Unlike the buildings in the settlements, only the interior of the spaceport is made of wood. `

It was originally settled as a mining world, and even now, food is harder to come by than in other regions of Altera. Over time, Noricum has developed a significant population and gained importance, especially since becoming the administrative capital of the inner Alteran worlds, the Borean Sector.`
	description `	Noricum is also home to a major Alteran naval base, mainly due to its location close to the galactic core and the Borean Sector, and bordering the presumably uninhabited Ember Waste. While the system itself does not actually count as a border system, most of the Borean Sector is within jump-drive range, allowing rapid reactions to any threats, especially around the sector border.`
	spaceport `The spaceport reflects the state of Noricum pretty well, several of the larger landing pads are reserved specifically for food-related freight ships. The military takes up another large portion of the spaceport, though mainly with transport vessels and smaller warships. The spaceport seems fairly well guarded, not from actual employed security, but simply because of the amount of military personnel present at all times, sitting around the spaceport.`

	description `	The landscape on Othala is particularly hospitable, so most of the population is located in one of 5 cities on the same part of the planet. Outside of these cities the terrain is quite rocky, and the temperature varies significantly depending on time and weather. A long time ago, there was an attempt to terraform Othala, but it ended in failure due to the bombings during the last war. The cities are located in partially terraformed sections with artificial weather.`
	spaceport `As with any world with manufacturing, the spaceport sees a lot of freight traffic, in particular raw materials from the orbiting moon of Orilla. While the spaceport was not initially built in the city center, the industry's preference for spaceport proximity has resulted in the port being surrounded by industrial complexes.`

	description `Sylvalum is a world of natural beauty, of sand and snow, with its sand seas, covering many flat portions of the landmass, being a particularly prominent feature. Temperatures on Sylvalum drop below freezing on a regular basis, resulting in a layer of snow, hiding much of the surface and, as well as the sand seas.`
	description `	Little industry exists on Sylvalum, as it has not yet become economically feasible to extract resources from below the sand seas or even the oceans. Instead, most of the population works in the tourism sector. Many visitors come in hopes of experiencing the mystical rising spores, an unforgettable, but also unpredictable phenomenon.`
	spaceport `The spaceport sits on a mostly rocky set of hills between a sand sea and the ocean, giving travelers a good view and ships an easy arrival vector. A city is located nearby, on a less pronounced section of hills, housing the vast majority of both permanent inhabitants and visitors. `
	spaceport `	As is to be expected from a tourism destination, most of the traffic is made up of transport vessels and luxury liners, as well as freighters, supplying the localities. This is also reflected in the layout, where most of the landing pads are right next to the passenger terminal and its extensions.`

	description `Turicum, probably the least expensive of the Alteran Paradise Worlds, is full of rolling green hills and rocky mountains, resulting in more weather variation than on Atlantis and Halcyon, including some less pleasant snow storms. As a result, the tourism industry is very large, both during summer and winter, giving Turicum a more casual economy. Several large cities are visible from space which have a large parks and green zones placed in their interior, reducing the population density.`
	description `	While some material industry is present here, Turicum is a net importer of almost everything. Additionally, a significant portion of the planet is still in its natural state and will stay this way due to the environmental protection laws in place.`
	spaceport `On the other side of a hill from one of the cities, connected by a maglev line, lies the only public spaceport on this world. It's made up of several landing areas and terminals for spaceships. Due to the tourism on this world, a lot of the traffic is made up of transport vessels. As such, a large section of the spaceport is trimmed towards and reserved almost exclusively for passenger transports. The military presence on Turicum on the other hand is barely large enough to justify a military section at the spaceport.`

	description `The permafrost world of Vanir is just outside of the Alteran Inner Core and can be reached from Celestis with just 2 jumps. It hasn't seen an ice-free day in the last millennium and is nearly inhospitable as a result. In its past, Vanir used to be abundant with life, though for an unknown reason, the planet started cooling, becoming a frozen wasteland, with no end in sight, even at this point in time.`
	description `	As a result of the ice age, most of the cities have been abandoned over the course of the last few millennia, except for a few smaller cities, which have had a dome built over them, to allow greenery on this white planet. They house researchers working in the laboratories, which benefit from the low legal restrictions of this world. Additionally, Draconium deposits have been found on Vanir, resulting in several mines spread over the planet. The Alteran Military conducts invasion training operations on Vanir as well.`
	spaceport `Compared to the other Alteran spaceports, this one is smaller and less open. Due to the planet's hostile nature, there are several gated horizontal entrances to some kind of underground spaceport, protecting the ships from the storms raging outside. This has however resulted and a less efficient design, only capable of properly handling small ships, as larger vessels don't fit through the gates. Consequently, only few large ships can be seen in the sky, and they only land near the military facilities, keeping their power and shields on for protection.`

	description `Wyvernhaven is one of the Alteran Central Worlds and generally regarded as the second most important planet, due to it being the seat of the United Alteran navy. This is immediately noticeable while landing as well, as most of the ships you can observe are flying under military colors and even the majority of civilian grade ships are flying for the Navy.`
	description `	While the military has a strong presence here, Wyvernhaven is also one of the more populous Alteran worlds, with a population lower than that of Celestis, but still relatively high, as it was settled millennia ago. Since a large part of the economy and populace are based around the military, Wyvernhaven can barely be called a civilian world.`
	spaceport `The civilian section of the spaceport is by no means small, mostly because of the amount of freighters coming in for the shipyards. As a result, the landing pads are very large and the surrounding infrastructure was designed to support highly efficient loading and transportation.`
	spaceport `	The military section, however, is even larger than the civilian section, built to handle a massive fleet. A large portion of the Alteran fleet is generally stationed here, both offensive and defensive fleet compositions can be seen on the ground and above, in the sky. The Alteran Military Shipyards produce a considerable percentage of their ships here, the medium and heavy warships in particular have a large presence in the hangar.`
