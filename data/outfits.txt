	"piercing resistance" 0.194
	description "In part due to its size, the largest and most efficient Alteran shield system, the ASSX-IV only comes equipped on Alteran capital ships. As such, it is not only incredibly powerful and expensive, but also offers significant protection against shield disruption and piercing, as well as burning."
