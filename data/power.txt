	description "This odd outfit is capable of harvesting power and fuel simultaneously from nearby stars. While the ASGX Solar Collector is highly efficient, it comes with the major drawback of using a gun port. The original designers decided that for supply and recon vessels, where guns aren't particularly important, the efficiency improvements were worth the gun port."

	description "the AAUX-I is standard on most Alteran vessels to even out peak power, supplementing solar collectors or other generators."
	description "The Alteran Accumulation Units suffer from cooling inefficiency, a major drawback, that quincidentally works well in combination with Draconic Reactors."

	description "The ABGX Backup Generator was initially used as its name suggests, but has since been replaced by integrated backup storage/generator systems in the Draconic Reactors. Instead, this generator model sees a lot of use in smaller craft a Draconic Reactor wouldn't make sense."

	description "Due to their efficiency, Draconic Reactors are present on most Alteran ships. With the ADRX-I being the smallest standard reactor and although it is relatively small, it is still very powerful and hot."
	description "Draconic Reactor outputs and efficiency increase with core temperature. A Battery is built-in to account for short but strong power bursts."

	#"heat generation" 86.4
	description "The ADRX-II is installed whenever the smaller ADRX-I's power supply is insufficient and is considerably larger and more powerful. While it is more space efficient, it does run less efficiently, producing more heat in the process."

	description "Used only by Alteran capital ships, the ADRX-III is the most powerful Draconic Reactor. Most ships would never need this much power and would most certainly be unable to fit one of these properly. Sale of the ADRX-III is heavily restricted."

	"ZPM capacity" -1
	description "The Zero Point Module (ZPM) extracts vacuum energy from an artificial region of subspace-time until it reaches maximum entropy. This allows it to generate tremendous amounts of energy, however, its energy source is finite and when maximum entropy is reached, the subspace-time region collapses and only the ZPM shell is left."

	description "Since only the larger Alteran ships are capable of equipping a ZPM, they built a large device with a single ZPM slot for the rare occasion where a ZPM may be needed."
