# About plugin

Adds a new civilization to the Ember Wastes: Alterans.  Alterans, like
Heliarchs, are a Tier 2.5 civilization in the Endless Sky universe.  In total,
there are about 80 systems related to Alteran territory.

This plugin adds:

* Government and planets related to Altera.
* Alteran ships and outfits purchasable on planetary shipyards and outfitters.
* Adds onto existing map for exploration.

# Development status: Alpha

* A highly WIP plugin.  Story is planned but not implemented.

Currently only adding several clusters east of the Ember-Waste (about 80
systems). The majority of these systems is inhabited by the Alterans, from which
you can purchase high level ships and outfits, more or less matching the
Heliarch tech level. There isn't really anything else to explore yet.
